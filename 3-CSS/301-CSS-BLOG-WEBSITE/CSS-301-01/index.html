                <p>Everyday digital interfaces include a rich variety of images,<br>
                    visualizations, and other pictures. However, more than anything else,<br>
                    they are made of words. Oh so many words. As we equip teams to design<br>
                    and code usable, consistent, beautiful interfaces using systems, it's<br>
                    essential that words depend on a strong foundation of typography.
                </p>
                <p>'ll admit, I am not a typography expert. I lack a graphic design degree.<br>
                    I'm never the person choosing a font, scaling type, or finessing letter<br>
                    spacing. As a result, I've always been reluctant to write about typography.<br>
                    On the other hand, I am a pattern hunter. Over the years, I've<br>
                    contributed to many design systems that set a foundation for typography.<br>
                    Each traversed of steps and decisions to set a foundation and apply it to<br>
                    in emerging library of interface components. This article summarizes
                </p>

                <p>
                    those patterns.
                    Typography starts by setting a foundation of font families and weights<br>
                    along with fallbacks. It then explores how to build hierarchy using<br>
                    color, additional details like line-height .<br>
                    Those models are then applied to components in a system's library (like<br>
                    Article and Header) as well as custom components made by other teams.
